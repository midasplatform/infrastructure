organize and cleanup the midas.pp script
case out the os specific info in one place, although there is really only full support for Ubuntu, so probably just kill CentOS
investigate keeping file contents we write out in an external file (cron and midas php config are cases)
install midas and enable modules, waiting on features in midas to support this, does puppet support curl?
investigate vagrant or some similar way of provisioning VMs
investigate a way to host the puppet file remotely, a central server for the puppet scripts, puppet-master?
investigate multiple different configurations of midas, a midas base, add solr support, condor, then the idea of a separate db server, web server and application server, profiles
